Visual RPG Studio (VRS) is a game engine and editor for Windows that allows you to create your own games without any special knowledge or training. You can use VRS to make 2D or 3D games with RPG elements, such as items, events, actors, and more. VRS works inside Visual Studio and directly produces .NET Framework binaries. VRS also supports Visual Lua, a scripting language that enables you to control every aspect of the game design.

VRS is not the only game engine that you can use to make RPG games. There are other popular tools, such as GameMaker Studio[^1^] and RPG Maker[^2^], that also allow you to create games with RPG elements. These tools have different features, advantages, and disadvantages, depending on your needs and preferences. For example, GameMaker Studio is more versatile and can support many types of games and applications, not just RPGs. RPG Maker is more specialized and has a large community of users and resources for making RPG games.
 
Some examples of games made with VRS are:

- Bad Monday Simulator: A game where you battle against the fusion of Sans and Garfield - Sansfield[^1^].
- Sang: The Desert Blade: A 2D action RPG inspired by Dark Souls and Zelda[^1^].
- CHROMATOSE: A decision-driven indie VN-RPG[^1^].

- The Lite edition does not support 3D features, such as dynamic shadows, blended terrain, and 3D models, while the Full edition does.
- The Lite edition does not include some addons, such as the Auto Updater, the Memory Management, and the TCP Client / Server, while the Full edition does.
- The Lite edition does not allow you to encrypt your game resources, while the Full edition does.
- The Lite edition does not allow you to publish your game as an executable file, while the Full edition does.
